# Loan Approval Prediction System

A machine learning-based web application that predicts loan approval status using Random Forest algorithm. Built with Python Flask backend and modern web interface.

## Overview

This project implements a loan approval prediction system using various machine learning models. After comparing KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, the Random Forest model was chosen for its superior performance.

## Features

- **ML Models Evaluated**: KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- **Best Model**: Random Forest (Selected for highest accuracy)
- **Modern UI**: Responsive design with instant predictions
- **Easy Input**: Simple form for user information
- **Clear Results**: Visual feedback for approval/rejection

## Tech Stack

- **Machine Learning**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Dataset**: Kaggle loan approval dataset
